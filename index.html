			Since current birth control methods are largely up to the woman to take care of, men are often not as informed about the different birth control options, or the costs, both monetary and otherwise, associated with different forms of birth control.
		</p>
		<p> 
			As a result, men who would like their partner to take care of birth control don't actually know the full extent of what they are asking their partner to go through.

			"Whenever I talk to guys about this stuff, I pose it to them as, 'If you had the option of using birth control, how would you take it? What responsibilities would you have?'" LaFaire said, "A lot of times guys just think birth control is a magic pill that just means they can't have a baby and don't have to use a condom."

			Particularly in long term relationships, couples often tend to rely on hormonal birth control pills because one or both partners prefer not to use condoms.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dr. Brandon Hill, a behavioral scientist in contraceptive and family planning research at the University of Chicago, has studied contraceptive trends and attitudes.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Condoms have been overly branded as STI prevention, which they do, but most don't consider it contraception, Hill said, "That's not what they have been sold as."
		</p> 
		<p>
			Because condoms are more closely associated with preventing sexually transmitted infections, many long-term couples stop using them once they become monogamous.
		</p>
		<p>
			This becomes an issue, however, when one partner, usually the female, still wants to use condoms as an additional, or even primary, birth control method. This brings in the issue of choice and personal freedom. Since a woman's body would take on the full consequences of an unintended pregnancy, should the woman be solely responsible for birth control decisions? What happens when the man in the relationship disagrees with his partner's preference?
		</p>
		<p>
			"It's a huge cultural shift to say men should have a part in the discussion," Hill said. "There are larger social discourse that genders birth control to women historically."

			The unequal information and unequal responsibility of birth control methods, an issue that so greatly affects both parties in a relationship, makes for complex power dynamics within the relationship. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Since women generally assume the majority of the responsibility due to the effectiveness and availability of female hormonal birth control pills, the woman usually makes the initial decision about birth control methods based on what works best for her body. 
		</p>
		<p>
			"It's tough because it's really important for a girl to figure out the right kind of birth control on her own, but she still has to consult her partner about it," said LaFaire.
		</p> 
		<p>
			Dr. Hill pointed out that conversations within a couple regarding birth control can be difficult, particularly because they tend to evoke sensitive questions about each partner's role in the relationship.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Gender dynamics are not equal power structures. There is a potential for a male to influence regardless of his level of knowledge," said Hill, "It can skew female partners' decision, adherence and continuation."
